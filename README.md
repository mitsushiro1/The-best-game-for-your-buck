# The-best-game-for-your-buck

## Description

The Best Game For Your Buck aims to provide users with an easy to navigate source for their gaming collections. Users are able to search their favourite games and find the best deals on the market. Using the rawg api, users can search for a game they are interested in and then with the help of cheapshark api they can see the best deals for their selection. 

Through creating this web application we as a team learned about the integration of several API's functioning together and the troubleshooting methods we needed. We created a well planned project from the beginning and were able to delegate our tastks appropriately and efficiently. 

As a future project we are aiming to deploy a multi layered search bar that will show users a selection of games from multiple search criteria of their choosing.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

No need to install, simply open webpage and use the search bar to find a game you are interested in.

## Usage

Once the webpage is open, the user can enter the term they are searching for. The more accurate the name, the more refined their results will be. Once a game is selected, they are redirected to the second page where information on the game's current on sale price as well as the location of the sale is displayed.
